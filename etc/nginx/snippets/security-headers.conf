# IMPORTANT — add_header inheritance: nginx inherits add_header from parent blocks
# ONLY when the location has zero add_header directives of its own. Any location
# using the cache snippets (which add X-Cache-Status) must explicitly include this
# file, because the cache snippet's add_header blocks server-level inheritance.
# This file is therefore included at the server block level AND inside cache1d/cache1h.
